Program:  Lights In-Alike
file:  first2.py


REQUIREMENTS:
Python 2.6x (earlier than this may work.  Python 3 compatibility doubtful)

Sys module (should be default?)

Random Module (should be default?)

Pygame module (separate download)

firstmouse module (included in this directory)


INSTRUCTIONS:

1) Open terminal/command prompt
2) Use python to open first2.py (terminal  $  python first2.py)
3) Terminal should ask for number of rows.  The number of rows also determines number of columns.
4) After number of rows is given, a window will fill in with colored blocks.  
5) Click on a block to change its color (and the color of non-diagonal adjacent blocks).
6) You want them all to be blue


Note:  Not all random permutations are solvable for some row/column configurations.  

7) Clicking out of the generated window will send a prompt to the terminal asking if you want to play a new game.  Yes will bring you back to number of rows question, no will close the game.  


Known bugs:  
Extremely large row numbers will generate no grid at all.  

The loop needs to be fixed so that quit operations are identical.

NOTE:
first.py is an earlier version.
